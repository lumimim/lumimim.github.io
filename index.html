                I am joining the <a href = "https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1399/13439.htm">College of AI</a> at <a href = "https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm">Tsinghua University</a> as an Assistant Professor, starting from May 2025. 
                I am looking for highly-motivated PhD students and interns to join Tsinghua University and <a href = "https://www.sqz.ac.cn/en/introduction">Shanghai Qizhi Institute</a>. Drop me an <a href="mailto:lumi.neuroai@gmail.com">email</a> if you are interested.

                <p>
                Before joining Tsinghua, I was an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://cse.gatech.edu">Gatech CSE</a> from 2024 to 2025 and <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/careers/shanahan-foundation-fellowship/"> a Shanahan Foundation Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a> and <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> from 2022 to 2024.
                Prior to that, I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a> in 2022, advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/">Nir Shavit</a>. 
                Concurrently, I was a fellow in the <a href="http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Center for Brain Science</a> from 2020 to 2022. I received a bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University.

                My research lies in the intersection of natural intelligence and artificial intelligence. I am working on accelerating scientific discovery in the brain with machine learning, and bridging the gap between artificial and biological neural networks. You could check my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12nAqDIZAsGt9WNhlxMaZUA4idO-mKZz6/view?usp=sharing">research summary</a> here. 
              </p>
	      <p>
		My research is recognized with several honors, including the MathWorks Fellowship, <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/careers/internships-and-postbac/shanahan-foundation-fellowship/Shanahan Foundation Fellowship/">Shanahan Foundation Fellowship</a>, and an NIH award. 
                I was selected as <a href="https://risingstars.utexas.edu/"> 2022 Rising Stars in EECS</a> and our work has been featured in <a href = "https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-optimize-rapid-neural-imaging-1106">MIT News</a> and  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgsA3pSzw2c">Forbes</a>.
	      </p>
	      <p> 
		I am broadly interested in
                <br>(1) Building fast and scalable automatic brain data collection pipelines.
                <br>(2) Developing interpretable and generalized methods in neuroscience for data-driven discovery, understanding the mechanisms of coding, computation, and learning within biological neural networks.
                <br>(3) Applications in brain computer interface, decoding brain signals into behaviors, images and languages.
		<br>(4) Building brain-inspired AI frameworks.
